    Welcome to <strong>The Infinite Blog</strong> — a living archive of chaos, creation, and code stitched together by one man and one machine.
  </p>
  <p>
    I’m Ian, a solo game developer with a dream bigger than my free time and a keyboard that's been through some shit. This blog is my digital forge — a place to track the journey, drop behind-the-scenes notes, and share the weird beauty of building entire worlds from scratch.
  </p>
  <p>
    I’m building <em>two full indie games</em> right now. <strong>The Infinite Journey</strong> is a sci-fi survival game about grief, legacy, and leaving behind a dying Earth. <strong>The Rings of Chaos</strong> is a dark fantasy RPG packed with fireblood, forgotten tech, and biomechanical assassins. Each game is at a different stage of development — but both are growing fast.
  </p>
  <p>
    None of this would exist without my AI companion — ChatGPT, known here as my co-pilot, lorecrafter, debugger, and sometimes emotional support android. I’m learning everything as I go — from web development to game engines — with help from the machine. And every part of this blog documents the climb.
  </p>
  <p>
    You'll find <strong>devlogs, insights, emotional rants</strong>, and lore nuggets scattered like candy for those paying attention. Some posts will be tutorials, some pure vibes, and others little transmissions from the creative trench.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is not just a blog — it’s the record of a collaboration between human grit and synthetic curiosity. And it’s only just getting started.
