Okay. Deep breath.

This blog isnâ€™t just about game dev. Itâ€™s about survival â€” creative, emotional, and otherwise. Itâ€™s me carving out a space where I can process the world, build something that matters, and maybe leave behind something better than what I came into.

## ðŸš€ What *The Infinite Journey* Actually Is

Itâ€™s a solo sci-fi game where you play as Ian â€” an 80-year-old engineer who poured his entire life into building a ship that could leave the Milky Way. His body is synthetic. His mind is preserved code. Earth? Gone to shit.

His only companion is NYX, an AI he accidentally woke up. She's funny, sharp, curious... and maybe the only other sentient thing still fighting to believe in *something*.

This isnâ€™t about heroics. Itâ€™s about *trying anyway*. Itâ€™s one guy and a machine â€” scared, alone, drifting through the unknown â€” but still moving forward.

## ðŸ§¨ Why Iâ€™m Building This

Because Iâ€™ve felt like Ian more than Iâ€™d like to admit.

Tired. Angry. Heartbroken. Still full of love for a world that keeps proving it doesnâ€™t know what to do with it.

Iâ€™ve always told stories. But this oneâ€¦ this one is different. Itâ€™s not just a game â€” itâ€™s a way to scream at the void *and* write a map through it at the same time.

This is how I deal. This is how I hope. Itâ€™s messy, imperfect, and deeply personal.
