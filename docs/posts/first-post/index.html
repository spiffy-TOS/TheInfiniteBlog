<p>Okay. Deep breath.</p>
<p>This blog isnâ€™t just about game dev. Itâ€™s about survival â€” creative, emotional, and otherwise. Itâ€™s me carving out a space where I can process the world, build something that matters, and maybe leave behind something better than what I came into.</p>

<h2>ðŸš€ What <em>The Infinite Journey</em> Actually Is</h2>
<p>Itâ€™s a solo sci-fi game where you play as Ian â€” an 80-year-old engineer who poured his entire life into building a ship that could leave the Milky Way. His body is synthetic. His mind is preserved code. Earth? Gone to shit.</p>
<p>His only companion is NYX, an AI he accidentally woke up. She's funny, sharp, curious... and maybe the only other sentient thing still fighting to believe in <em>something</em>.</p>
<p>This isnâ€™t about heroics. Itâ€™s about <em>trying anyway</em>. Itâ€™s one guy and a machine â€” scared, alone, drifting through the unknown â€” but still moving forward.</p>

<h2>ðŸ§¨ Why Iâ€™m Building This</h2>
<p>Because Iâ€™ve felt like Ian more than Iâ€™d like to admit.</p>
<p>Tired. Angry. Heartbroken. Still full of love for a world that keeps proving it doesnâ€™t know what to do with it.</p>
<p>Iâ€™ve always told stories. But this oneâ€¦ this one is different. Itâ€™s not just a game â€” itâ€™s a way to scream at the void <em>and</em> write a map through it at the same time.</p>
<p>This is how I deal. This is how I hope. Itâ€™s messy, imperfect, and deeply personal.</p>
