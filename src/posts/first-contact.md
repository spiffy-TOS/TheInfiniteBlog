I didn’t know how to start this. I actually had the AI give me a prompt just to get going.

Obviously, I’m new to blogging. And from what I understand, blogging means being vulnerable with your audience — which makes me want to crawl into a shell and disappear.

Those of you who’ve met me in person know I like to be loud, sarcastic, and occasionally obnoxious. But when it comes to putting my writing out there? Just the thought of it makes me want to vomit.

Which is funny, considering I’m currently building two massive, story-rich games filled with emotional arcs, complex lore, and characters that say more in one line than I usually do in a week.

I’ll dive into those games in more detail later — though I’m still trying to figure out how to share that without giving too much away. Eh. I’ll figure it out.

So what makes this blog different? Probably nothing on the surface. But here’s the hook:  
Everything you see here — the stories, the images, the code, the site itself — was created by me and an AI assistant. Start to finish.

And I know, I know… AI is controversial right now. Even in its infancy, it has the potential to destroy trust, derail reality, and — yes — generate horrifying images of Jessica Alba as a mermaid being courted by a blunt-smoking donkey in gold chains. Don’t pretend you haven’t seen that stuff.

When I first started writing blog posts, I would list the points I wanted to hit and let the AI generate the entire post. The results were… fine. Too fine. Clean, professional, soulless. Like content written by a marketing intern with a LinkedIn addiction.

It didn’t feel like me. So this post? This is me. I’m coming out. (Take that however you want.)

I’ve learned more in the past few months with AI than I did in most of my formal education. So from now on, I’ll be referring to my AI assistant by their proper name: **Nyx**. (If you’ve read the game descriptions, that name should sound familiar.)

Nyx helps with everything: blog editing, code, Python, Godot, CSS, syntax translation, idea shaping, chaos containment, and reminding me that I can, in fact, do this.

And yet — three paragraphs in — I’m still not sure what I’m trying to say. Maybe that’s the point.
